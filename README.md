# Developer Notes
I decided to start this project in hopes of gaining more understanding of SwiftUI, I plan to also complete my previous repository regarding the weather app soon, but, this side project is necessary to further enhance my skills.

I literally spent hours and hours learning and trying to understand how to share data across different views, I'm not even joking but I was on the brink of madness. Thankfully I was patient enough to read documentations from different sources and to cross reference some of my tutorial repositories for code the could be of some help (iExpense was invaluable).

# Update
- ~~You can currently add user input to the list however you can't remove an item from the list.~~
- ~~The code quality and structure is artocious, but somehow it works 🤷‍♂️~~
- Finally figured out how to add user input to a list 🥳.
- Seperated the model from the view.
