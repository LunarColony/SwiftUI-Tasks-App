# SimpleToDoList

# Developer Notes
I decided to start this project in hopes of gaining more understanding of SwiftUI, I plan to also complete my previous repository regarding the weather app soon, but, this side project is necessary to further enhance my skills.

The goal is to actually complete this one within a few days, fingers crossed. 🙏

# Update
- You can currently add user input to the list however you can't remove an item from the list.
- The code quality and structure is artocious, but somehow it works 🤷‍♂️
