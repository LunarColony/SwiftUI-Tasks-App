#  ✅ SimpleToDoList
A simple todo list app created using SwiftUI. 

# Update
- ~~You can currently add user input to the list however you can't remove an item from the list.~~
- ~~The code quality and structure is artocious, but somehow it works 🤷‍♂️~~
- Finally figured out how to add user input to a list 🥳.
- Seperated the model from the view.

# Things TODO
- [x] Give the user the option to select a catergory for each task.
- [x] Add priority ratings from low to critical.
- [ ] Implement a search feature.
- [ ] Implement time stamps for each task and task descriptions.
- [ ] Implement sub-tasks within Parent task, this will inform the user the progression stage of the task 📊.
- [ ] Re-Do entire code base as the structure doesn't follow a design pattern and debugging is incredibly frustrating.
